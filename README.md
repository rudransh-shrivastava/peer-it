# Peer It is a peer to peer file transfer system

Features [WIP]:
- A tracker server to keep track of files and peers.
- A custom protocol over TCP to transmit files and introduce self to trackers.
- A CLI for downloading and registering new files.
- A `.p2p` or `.pit` file extension that can store the trackers ip, the files checksums, etc.

This project is work in progress.
